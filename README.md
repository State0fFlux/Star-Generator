# Star-Generator
This is a project that started as an assignment for my Intro to Scientific Computing (AMATH 301) course at University of Washington. I have since expanded its functionality to allow for more user customization of the stars being generated.

## Included Files:
* star_builder.py
  * contains algorithms for star generation  
* client.py
  * provides a more user-friendly guide in generating stars from points and skip patterns  
* mass_generator.py
  * a simple nested loop that allows for iterative generation of star flipbooks (used to create the fun little animation!)  
* star_bounce.gif
  * fun little animation
